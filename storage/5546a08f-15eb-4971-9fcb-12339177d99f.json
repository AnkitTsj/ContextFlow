{"input": "first rate my portfolio i built this evening - \nhttps://ankittsj.github.io/\n\n\nfavicon\nFetched Ankit Kumar\ngithub.io\n\nI can see your portfolio, and here's my honest feedback:\n\nThe Good:\n\nClean, minimal design that loads quickly\nClear focus on machine learning projects\nGood project variety (CLI tools, finetuning, CNN visualization)\nAreas for Improvement:\n\nContent & Presentation:\n\nThe description is quite brief and has some typos (\"ocassionaly\" should be \"occasionally\")\nProject descriptions are very short - they need more detail about what problems you solved, technologies used, and impact/results\nMissing key sections like About, Skills, Experience, or Contact information\nNo visual elements like screenshots, demos, or project images\nTechnical Details:\n\nLinks to actual projects/repos appear to be missing\nNo indication of tech stack, programming languages, or frameworks you use\nNo metrics or outcomes for your projects (performance improvements, accuracy gains, etc.)\nProfessional Polish:\n\nNeeds more personality and storytelling - what drives your interest in ML?\nConsider adding a photo and more personal context\nThe layout could use some visual hierarchy and better spacing\nQuick Wins:\n\nFix typos and expand descriptions\nAdd project links and screenshots\nInclude a proper About section\nAdd contact information\nShow some personality in your writing\nFor an evening's work, it's a solid start, but it needs more content and polish to effectively showcase your skills to potential employers or collaborators. What's your main goal with this portfolio?\n\n\n\n\ncan you help me add better project descriptions? \nand should i write about as - \n\"I am Ankit, a developer focused on machine learning. I build projects, implement research papers and sometimes write blogs and ocassionaly explore web development.\ni like ciphering my spells to train networks, so they can be intelligent.\"\nor is it cheesy? \nask me questions on improving project description\n\nThat description is definitely on the cheesy side - \"ciphering spells\" feels a bit too whimsical for a professional portfolio. The first part is good and straightforward, which works better.\n\nLet me ask some questions to help improve your project descriptions:\n\nFor the CLI tool (LLM runner):\n\nWhat's it called and what problem does it solve?\nWhich LLMs does it support? (Llama, GPT variants, etc.)\nWhat makes it different from existing tools like Ollama?\nWhat programming language/frameworks did you use?\nAny performance benchmarks or user adoption metrics?\nFor the Mistral 7B finetuning:\n\nWhat dataset did you finetune on and for what specific task?\nWhat were the performance improvements? (accuracy, perplexity, etc.)\nWhat hardware setup did you use?\nAny interesting challenges you overcame during training?\nHow does it compare to the base model?\nFor the CNN visualization tool:\n\nWhat visualization techniques does it use? (Grad-CAM, saliency maps, etc.)\nWhich CNN architectures does it support?\nWhat insights have you gained from using it?\nIs it web-based, desktop app, or notebook-based?\nAny cool examples of patterns it revealed?\nGeneral questions:\n\nDo you have GitHub repos for these projects?\nAny blog posts or documentation you've written about them?\nWhich project are you most proud of and why?\nAlso, for the About section - what got you into ML? Any interesting background or unique perspective you bring?\n\n\n\n\n1 - qbench \nit supports any llm that your machine can run, \nit quantizes the models where ollama doesn't do it, \ni used a lot of frameworks like psutil, huggungface-hub, shutil, \nno benchmarks , it's dependent on user machine \n2 - i finetunes it on synthetic dataset generated using gemini, \ndataset is here - https://huggingface.co/datasets/mldevAnkit/rhymer_tones\nperplexity decreased from 10.8+ to 5.7+\n, it was 6gb 3050, no issues, just data generation where i used gemini api, it's better compared to the base model\n3 - grad-cam, it supports vgg, it is soon going to be web-based, currently cli, soon ( maybe tomorrow i will build the web ) \nwhat got me into ml was - i wanted to create this environment of very smart ai so that they can do a lot of task for me and make me feel like a superhero \n( i can't write that and i know this )\n\nGreat info! Here are better project descriptions:\n\nQBench - Local LLM CLI Tool \"A command-line tool that enables efficient local execution of large language models with automatic quantization capabilities. Unlike existing tools like Ollama, QBench focuses on model optimization through quantization to maximize performance on resource-constrained hardware. Built with Python using psutil for system monitoring, Hugging Face Hub for model management, and custom quantization algorithms. Supports any LLM architecture that can run locally, automatically optimizing memory usage and inference speed based on available system resources.\"\n\nMistral 7B Finetuning for Rhyming Generation \"Fine-tuned Mistral 7B on a custom synthetic dataset for creative text generation with rhyming patterns. Generated training data using Gemini API and curated it into a specialized dataset (available on Hugging Face as mldevAnkit/rhymer_tones). Achieved significant performance improvements with perplexity reduction from 10.8+ to 5.7+. Trained on RTX 3050 6GB using efficient training techniques, demonstrating that high-quality model customization is achievable on consumer hardware.\"\n\nCNN Pattern Visualizer \"A visualization tool for understanding CNN decision-making through Grad-CAM implementation. Currently supports VGG architectures with plans for expansion. Reveals the specific image regions and patterns that influence model predictions, helping debug model behavior and build trust in AI decisions. Initially developed as a CLI tool with an upcoming web interface for broader accessibility and real-time visualization.\"\n\nFor your About section, try: \"I'm Ankit, a machine learning developer passionate about making AI more accessible and understandable. My journey into ML started with a vision of building intelligent systems that could augment human capabilities - essentially creating AI tools that make complex tasks feel effortless.

Think of it as an API specification that lets LLMs interact with the outside world in a structured way.\n\nThe Problem MCP Solves:\n\nLLMs are stateless and can't directly access files, databases, APIs, or real-time data\nEvery AI application was building custom integrations differently\nNo standard way to give models \"tools\" or \"functions\" they could reliably use\nHow it Works (Technical):\n\nClient-Server Architecture: Your AI app is the client, tools/services are MCP servers\nJSON-RPC Protocol: Communication happens over JSON-RPC (can be over stdio, HTTP, WebSocket)\nStandardized Messages: Defined message types for tool discovery, execution, resource access\nCapability Negotiation: Client and server negotiate what functions are available\nKey Components:\n\nTools: Functions the LLM can call (e.g., search_database, send_email, fetch_weather)\nResources: Data sources the LLM can read (files, URLs, database records)\nPrompts: Reusable prompt templates the LLM can access\nFor Your B2B GenAI SaaS:\n\nYou'd implement MCP servers for your customer's tools (CRM, databases, APIs)\nYour AI can then natively interact with their existing systems\nCustomers get AI that actually knows their data and can take actions\nYou avoid building custom integrations for every client\nExample Flow:\n\nLLM: \"I need to find all customers from last month\"\n→ MCP call to your CRM server\n→ CRM returns customer data\n→ LLM processes and responds to user\nWant me to explain any specific part deeper or talk about implementation strategies?\n\n", "context": "Here's a breakdown of the context extracted from the chat, categorized for future reference:\n\n## Technical\n\n*   **Portfolio Structure:**\n    *   Feedback on portfolio website: Minimal design, loading speed, project variety, missing links/repos, missing tech stack/languages/frameworks, missing metrics, visual elements.\n    *   Needs: Links to actual projects/repos, tech stack, programming languages, frameworks, metrics, outcomes for projects.\n*   **LLM CLI Tool (QBench):**\n    *   Supports any LLM that the machine can run.\n    *   Focuses on model quantization (unlike Ollama).\n    *   Uses Python, psutil, Hugging Face Hub, and custom quantization algorithms.\n    *   No benchmarks (dependent on user machine).\n*   **Mistral 7B Finetuning:**\n    *   Finetuned on a synthetic dataset generated using Gemini.\n    *   Dataset URL: `https://huggingface.co/datasets/mldevAnkit/rhymer_tones`\n    *   Perplexity decreased from 10.8+ to 5.7+.\n    *   Trained on a 6GB 3050.\n    *   Used efficient training techniques.\n*   **CNN Pattern Visualizer:**\n    *   Uses Grad-CAM.\n    *   Supports VGG architectures.\n    *   Currently CLI-based; web-based version planned.\n*   **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Explanation:**\n    *   Standardized way for AI models to connect with external tools, databases, and services (API specification).\n    *   Solves statelessness/lack of access to data/tools/real-time data problems.\n    *   Technical details: Client-server architecture, JSON-RPC protocol, standardized messages, capability negotiation.\n    *   Key components: Tools (functions), Resources (data), Prompts (templates).\n    *   Implications for a B2B GenAI SaaS: Implementing MCP servers for customer's tools, Native AI interaction, avoiding custom integrations.\n    *   Example Flow: LLM - > MCP call to CRM server - >CRM returns data -> LLM processes/responds.\n\n## Creative\n\n*   **Portfolio Description (Initial Draft):**\n    *   \"I am Ankit, a developer focused on machine learning.
